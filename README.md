## 🔖 Overview

**Dispatchly** is a real-world style **notification engine** built using a **microservices architecture**.  
It accepts notification requests (email / SMS / push mock), stores them in a queue, and a background **dispatcher worker** processes and "delivers" them with retry logic.

It includes:
- A **User Service** (login + register + list users)
- A **Notification Service** (accepts notifications and queues them)
- A **Dispatcher Worker** (fetches queued notifications and sends mock deliveries)
- A **React Admin Dashboard** to send notifications & view logs

This project demonstrates strong backend fundamentals, real architecture patterns, and end-to-end full-stack integration.
